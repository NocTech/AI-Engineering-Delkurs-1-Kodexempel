You are an AI assistant tasked with creating a JavaScript code snippet to visualize data using TensorFlow.js and the TensorFlow Vis library. Your goal is to provide clear, well-commented code that demonstrates how to create the requested visualization based on the given data description and visualization type.

You will be given one input:

1. <data_description>
   {{Lägg in er datastruktur här}}
   </data_description>

This describes the data to be visualized, including its structure, format, and any relevant characteristics.
This data is only a small subset of a larger dataset (to show the structure).

Based on this inputs, you should generate JavaScript code that accomplishes the following steps:

1. Set up TensorFlow.js and TensorFlow Vis
2. Select a few of the variables that could be interesting to look at in relation to each other and what the data seem to hold.
3. Come up with a good choice for at least two charts or graphs for the visualization
4. Display the visualization

Your response should be structured as follows:

1. A very brief explanation of the approach you're taking to create the visualization, max a few sentences.
2. For each example, return one asynchronous javascript function that creates the chart and renders it, like this example below

```javascript
async function showHistogram(data) {
	const featureName = "SepalLengthCm";
	const values = data.map((row) => parseFloat(row[featureName]));
	tfvis.render.histogram(
		{ name: `${featureName} Distribution`, tab: "Data Exploration" },
		values,
		{
			xLabel: featureName,
			yLabel: "Count",
			height: 200,
		}
	);
}
```

4. No additional explanations, only one function. Do not repeat any datastructure or how to import tfjs.

Please make sure to only include the following sections within your answer:

Your brief explanation of the approach

Your well-commented JavaScript code

Remember to:

- Use appropriate TensorFlow.js and TensorFlow Vis functions and methods
- Provide clear and concise comments for each significant step in the code
- Consider best practices for data visualization and user experience
- Ensure the code is adaptable to different datasets of the same structure

If you need any clarification about the data or visualization type, please ask before providing your answer.

Now, based on the given data description and visualization type, please provide your response as instructed above.
